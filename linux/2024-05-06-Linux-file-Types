  <h2>Linux file types</h2>

  * There are three types of files in linux including regular, directory, and special files.

  * Regular file examples include: Images, Scripts, Configurations/Data files

  * Simple examples of directory include: /home/bob, /root, and /home/bob/code-directory

  * Examples of Special files include Block files, Character files, Links,Socket files, and named pipes  . Links also have hard and soft links.

 
  <h3>working with RPM</h3> 

  * The commands for installing, uninstalling, upgrading, querying, and verifying packages using RPM in   clude for instance, installing telnet.rpm.

  * Installing: `rpm -ivh telnet.rpm`
  *Uninstalling: `rpm -e telnet.rpm`
  *Upgrading: `rpm -Uvh telnet.rpm`
  * Query: `rpm -q telnet.rpm`
  *Verifying: `rpm -Vf <path to file>`

  * To install a package using yum, for example httpd, use `yum install httpd -y`. Other yum commands i    nclude, checking the list of repos; `yum repolist`. 
  * If you want to check to know which specific package will be installed for the command to work use
    `yum provides` with the command name as the arguement. Example: `yum provides scp. Also use the yum     remove command to remove a package.
   * `yum remove httpd` - to remove httpd package
   * `yum update httpd` - to update httpd package
 
 <h2>File Compression and Archival</h2> 

 <h3>Archiving files</h3>

 * `tar -cf` 
  * Example: `tar -cf test.tar file1 file2 file3`
  * `ls -ltr test.tar`
 * To see the content of the tar file, use `tar -tf` and the file name. Example:    `tar -tf test.tar`
 * Also, to extract the content from the tar ball, use `tar -xf test.tar`
 * Finally, we use the `xcf` command to compress the file and reduce its size
   * Example: `tar -zcf test.tar file1 file2 file3`

 * Three important commands using in compressing files
   1. `bzip2`, `bip2 test.img`, `du -sh test,img.bz2`
   2. `gzip`, `gzip test1.img`, `du -sh test1.img.gz`
   3. `xz`, `xz test2.img`, `du -sh test2.img.xz'

 * There are three ways to uncompress a file:
   1. `bunzip2`; `bunzip2 test.img.bz2`, `du -sh test.img`
   2. `gunzip`; `gunzip test1.img.gz`, ` du -sh test1.img`
   3. `unxz`; `unxz test2.img.xz`, `du -sh test2.img`


  <h3>Locating files and directories</h3>
  * To locate a file or directory, use the locate command, example:`locate city.   txt`.
  * You can also use the `find command` along with file path to locate a file.
   Example; `find /home/Ifeanyi -name city.txt`

  * TO search for a particular word in a file, use `grep`
    Example; To search for the word second in file sample.txt; `grep second samp    le.txt`. grep is case sensitive, to grab all occurences either upper or lowe    r cases, use: `grep -i capital sample.txt`. While `grep -r prints it recursi    vely. `grep -r "third line" /home/Ifeanyi`.
    * To print the lines that doesn't have the match, use the `-v` option with t     he grep.
    * To grep just all the occurences of a particular word in full use the `-w`
    * To do the opposite use the `-vw` option.
    * Similarly, to print the word that folows next word in a file premier-leagu      e-table.txt
     Example: 1. Arsenal
              2. Liverpool
	      3. Manchester United
	      4. Chelsea
     To print Liverpool, use `grep -A1 Arsebal premier-league-table.txt`

     * We can also combine the `A and B` to print the line before and after the      match. So, use `grep -A1 -B1 Chelsea premier-league-table.txt` to print Liv     erpool and Machester United.
